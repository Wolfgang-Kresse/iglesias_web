# iglesias_web

This is a small leaflet-application. It shows most of the churches in Ayacucho, Peru, with an OSM-map in the background.
By clicking on the yellow dots, a picture of the church will appear. A second click will shown an enlargement.
This example was created during a postgraduate study-course in geomatics at the Universidad Nacional de San Cristobal de Huamanga (UNSCH).
